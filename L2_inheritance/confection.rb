# We have a `Confection` class representing baked desserts. Your job is to create a new subclass of `Confection`, named `Cupcake` and `Banana Cake`. Cupcakes and Banana Cakes need to be baked just like other confections, but cupcakes also need to be frosted afterward. Write a `prepare` method for your `Cupcake` and `Banana Cake` class that prints "Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.", and then prints "Applying frosting" for `Cupcake` only.

class Confection
  def prepare
      puts "Baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes."
  end
end

class BananaCake < Confection
  def prepare
      super
  end
end

class Cupcake < Confection
  def prepare
  super
  puts "Applying frosting..."
  end
end

cupcake = Cupcake.new
bananacake = BananaCake.new

cupcake.prepare
bananacake.prepare
